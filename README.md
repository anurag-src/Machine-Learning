### :busts_in_silhouette: The Team
* Rishabh Jain
* Syed Jamal
* Anurag Sidharth Aribandi

### ðŸ”Ž About
* The models coded are Logistic Regression, Aritifical Neural Network, Fischer's Linear Discriminant, Naive Bayes Classifier and Linear Perceptron.
* There is also a Comprehensive Comparison of multiple models in the CC folder.
* Each folder has a report about the implemented model, the code for the model and the dataset on which it runs.

### :key: Run the Code
* Ensure that the dataset path and name match to the downloaded file and location.
* All the models are python files or jupyter notebooks and are fairly straightforward to run
* The output varies based on model, some models output graphs. The outputs are detailed in the reports.
  
### :books: Libraries Used
* Numpys
* NTLK
* sklearn (For the CC file, all other models are implemented from scratch)
